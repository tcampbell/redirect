# Simple URL redirector

I need a link shortener where I can control namespaces to make sense
of all the URLs passed around.


# Install instructions

1. Install virtualenv

2. `./bin/activate` to activate a local python environment for this session.

3. TODO: bootstrap on the first run

4. Hack around, you are now in a custom python environment.

5. `./bin/deactivate` to exit your virtual python environment or just exit your current session.
